# ModelRocket
A C++ Physics Simulator for Rockets for AP Computer Science.
There are two classes, projectile and rocket. A projectile is a simple class that stores information about how far the projectile has traveled, its mass, its cross sectional areas (across both the X and Y planes), and the drag coefficents across the x and y planes. 
The second class, rocket extends projectile and adds the amount of thrust and any flow rate and burn time information to the projectile.
